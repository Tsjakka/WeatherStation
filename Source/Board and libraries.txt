To compile the WeatherStation code, you will have to install the ESP32 boards package
for the Arduino IDE and a several libraries.

In the Arduino IDE, go to the Preferences (shortcut Ctrl+comma) and enter the following
URL after "Additional Boards Manager URLs:". If there already is a URL there, you may
add the URL to the existing one, separated by a comma.

https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

Then, select the ESP32 device you are using by selecting Tools / Board and then the device.

In the Tools / Library Manager dialog install the following libraries.

Adafruit BusIO
Adafruit SHT31 Library
Adafruit Unified Sensor
ArduinoOTA
DCF77
SPIFlash_LowPowerLab
RFM69_LowPowerLab
Time

If you get a build error on DCF77.c, then add #include <TimeLib.h> to C:\Users\<your_name>\Documents\Arduino\libraries\DCF77\DCF77.h below #include <Time.h>.
